# GTKWave

GTKWave is a JavaFX application designed to visualize waveforms represented in a CSV file format. It provides a user-friendly interface for viewing signals and their dependencies, zooming in and out on the timeline, and manipulating signal data.

## Features

- **Signal Visualization**: View waveforms of signals loaded from a CSV file.
- **Signal Expansion**: Double-click on signals to expand multibit signals into individual bits.
- **Signal Dependencies**: View and explore dependencies of signals.
- **Zoom Control**: Navigate through the timeline by moving forward or backward.
- **Signal Manipulation**: Add, delete, and save signals.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
   
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
    ```
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

3. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the project directory and run the application using:
    ```
    java -jar GTKWave.jar
    ```

4. **Load Data**: Load your waveform data by opening a CSV file from the application menu.

5. **Explore and Manipulate**: Explore the waveforms, manipulate signals, and save your changes.

## Usage

- **Signal ListView**: Displays a list of loaded signals. Double-click on a signal to expand it into individual bits.
  
- **WavePane**: Visualizes the waveforms of the loaded signals. Click on the timeline to view data values at specific time points.

- **Menu Bar**: Provides options for file operations (new, open, save, exit) and help (about).
